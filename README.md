# Piscine C++

Welcome to the C++ Piscine! This project is designed to help you learn and master C++, from `cpp00` to `cpp09`. Each module introduces essential concepts to become a proficient C++ developer. Here is a summary of the concepts covered in each module:

## Modules

### C++ - Module 00
**Concepts:** Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, `static`, `const`, and other basics.  
**Summary:** This module introduces the basics of C++: using namespaces, creating classes, defining member functions, handling standard input/output streams (`iostream`), using initialization lists, and understanding `static` and `const` keywords.

### C++ - Module 01
**Concepts:** Memory allocation, member pointers, references, `switch` statement.  
**Summary:** This module focuses on memory management with pointers, references, and member pointers. It also covers the `switch` statement for control flow.

### C++ - Module 02
**Concepts:** Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, canonical form.  
**Summary:** This module introduces ad-hoc polymorphism through operator overloading, and the basics of the Coplien form (default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, destructor).

### C++ - Module 03
**Concepts:** Inheritance.  
**Summary:** This module deals with inheritance in C++. It teaches how to create derived classes, use constructors and destructors in class hierarchies, and implement virtual methods.

### C++ - Module 04
**Concepts:** Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.  
**Summary:** This module explores subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. It teaches how to design class hierarchies where some functions are implemented in derived classes.

### C++ - Module 05
**Concepts:** Exceptions, repetitive handling.  
**Summary:** This module covers exception handling in C++ and repetitive handling of concepts and structures to manage complex error scenarios.

### C++ - Module 06
**Concepts:** C++ casts.  
**Summary:** This module focuses on different types of casts in C++ (`static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`) and their appropriate usage.

### C++ - Module 07
**Concepts:** C++ templates.  
**Summary:** This module introduces templates in C++, teaching how to write generic functions and classes that can work with any data type.

### C++ - Module 08
**Concepts:** Container templates, iterators, algorithms.  
**Summary:** This module covers container templates, using iterators, and standard library algorithms. You will learn to manipulate generic data structures efficiently.

### C++ - Module 09
**Concepts:** STL (Standard Template Library).  
**Summary:** This final module delves into the STL, teaching you how to use standard containers, algorithms, and iterators to write performant and maintainable C++ code.

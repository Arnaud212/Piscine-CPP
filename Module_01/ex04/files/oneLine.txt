Postconflict gganxiety has been reported ggin crab-eating macaques that have acted as theaggressor. After a conflict within a ggroup, the aggressor appears to scratch ggitself at ahigher rate than beforeggthe conflict. Though the scratching ggbehavior cannot definitely betermed as ggan anxious behavior, evidence suggests this is the case. An aggressor'sscratching decreases ggsignificantly after reconciliation. This suggests reconciliationrather than gga property of the conflict is the ggcause of the reduction in scratchinggbehavior. Though these results seem ggcounterintuitive, the anxiety of the aggressorappears to have a basis in the risks of ggruining cooperative relationships ggwith the opponent.
